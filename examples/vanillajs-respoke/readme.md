# Respoke & VanillaJS TodoMVC Example

> Respoke lets you easily integrate text chat, audio calling, video collaboration, screen sharing, and peer-to-peer data transfer without the hassle of maintaining servers and traversing firewalls. Respoke works with just a few lines of JavaScript and is best used in combination with a JavaScript MV* framework such as EmberJS, AngularJS or Backbone.

## How To Use This TodoMVC

First install all the application dependencies:

`npm install`

`bower install`

`gulp`

Then open the TodoMVC in two different browser instances. 

For example, open one instance in Chrome and the second instance in Firefox. Or open one instance in Chrome and the second instance in Chrome incognito.

## Respoke TodoMVC Integration

Respoke provides a real-time communication platform for frontend JavaScript apps. Here,
we combine Respoke with VanillaJS to create a real-time collaborative Todo app where each Todo instance can be created, read, updated and deleted by team members across the world using different browsers.

There is very little difference between this app and the vanilla VanillaJS
Todo app (see what I did there). The only material change is integrating all Todo features with Respoke.JS to create a real-time collaborative environment for creating Todo tasks among teams. Think Goolge Docs for Todos.
